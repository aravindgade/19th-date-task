    <p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Top level management was not involved and the BSC was delegated to
middle management, which does not have a clear vision of the organization’s
strategy overall.</p>
    
    <p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A top-level executive attempted to construct the BSC alone; generally this
is someone from finance or planning.</p>
    
    <p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsibilities for the BS are not shared by the lower levels of the
organization — divisions, business units and individual departments.</p>
    
    <p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treating the BSC at a single event and not as a continuous process in
which the objectives, indicators and goals can be revised based on
organizational learning.</p>
    
    <p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confusing the BSC with a project, delegating its implementation to an
outside consultant, spending for the computerization of all the data and
creating a standard reporting interface.</p>
    
    <p>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introducing the BSC just for compensation, adding non-financial measures to the incentive programs.</p>
    
    <br><br>
    
    <p>Mercer (1999) did a study of 214 companies and discovered that 88%
consider that the results of the BSC are more effective when linked to
compensation systems. One the other hand, they found that developing a
system of compensation appropriate to the BSC is not easy.</p>
    
    <p>Another curious point has to do with developing measurements for the BSC.
Some organizations use too few measures in their BSC (one or two per
perspective) and never achieve a balance between the desired results and the
performance drivers of these results. Others include so many measurements
that they spend little time on those that have an effective impact on strategy.
Finally, the organization cannot identify the correct drivers, i.e., those that do,
in fact, translate into strategy. But these errors can be easily corrected if it is
realized that the BSC is a continuing process and that measurements can be
redefined.</p>

    <p>An article by Epstein and Manzoni does a critical analysis of the process of
implanting the Balanced Scorecard and Tableau de Bord methodologies, of
American and French origin, respectively. Table 6.2 shows the benefits and
success factors in applying these tools.</p>
    
    <p>For Hauser and Katz (1998) in their provocatively titled article, “Metrics: You
are what you measure!” metrics feed a process of action and reaction, and if
they are not well defined, can have critical consequences for organizations.
According to these authors, metrics, independently of the way they are used,
affect actions and decisions within an organization, which in turn affects the
results obtained.</p>

    <p>Hauser and Katz (1998) allege that good measures are hard to implement and
        require a lot of work, warning of<i>seven pitfalls</i>that should be avoided:</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>1. <b>Delaying rewards:</b> avoid tying goals and benefits just to the long term;</p>
    
    <p>2. employing<i><b>risky rewards</b></i>that affect the selection/rejection of projects in
function of unclear metrics, which permit choosing the lesser risk compromising the probability of results in the long term;
</p>
    
    <p>3. use of<i><b>metrics that are hard to control,</b></i> which are difficult to correlate
with day-to-day activities;</p>
    
    <p>4.<i><b>losing sight of the goal</b></i>such that metrics distort the real objectives of the
organization because they are not in line with the real needs of clients and
the business of the company;</p>
    
    <p>5. choice of<i><b>metrics that are precisely wrong,</b></i>i.e., metrics that are
calibrated with great precision, but lose their focus since they are not clear
to managers and employees;</p>
    
    <p>6.<i><b>Assuming your managers and employees have no options,</b></i> i.e., the
entire cost and effort of implementation, control, and search for the
desired results through a system of metrics that does not reflect the value
added to employees and managers;</p>
    
    <p> 7.<b>thinking narrowly,</b> i.e., it should be a system of creative measurements
– breaking paradigms.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>On the other hand, the authors recommend seven steps to obtain a good system
of metrics, as follows:</p>
    
    
    <br><br><br>
    
    <p>1. <b>Start by listening to the voice of customer</b>(VOC) in order to
determine which results should be procured and consequently what goals
should be implemented</p>
    
    <p>2.<b>Understand the job </b>(voice of employee — VOE), i.e., what generates
value for the employee beyond financial bonuses, ponder these values and
understand the processes and activities of the business.</p>
    
    <p>3. <b>Understand the interrelationships</b>among the metrics, aiming to assure
harmony in the use of various metrics, avoiding conflicting goals between
departments that hinder the search for an overall result for the organization.</p>
    
    <p>4. <b>Understand the linkages</b>among different measurements, identifying
client needs, seeking to understand how they can be reached through
internal processes, and establish a link between these processes and the
expected results.</p>
    
    <p>5. <b>Try to test the correlations and test manager and employee reaction,</b>i.e., test correlation among metrics and results, obtaining information
from managers and employees during implementation and utilizing pilot
projects, research and communication.</p>
    
    <p>6. <b>Involve managers and employees,</b> i.e. involve people who will use and
suffer the pressures of the measurement system while developing it; this
will guarantee that participation lead to legitimacy, commitment, and
better understanding.</p>
    
    <p>7. <b>Seek new paradigms,</b> utilizing steps one to six creatively, not limiting the
organization.</p>

    <h2>Case Study: Strategy and
Decisions in Perspective</h2>
    <div class="underline"></div>

    <h3>Case – Implementing the BSC at Unibanco Bank</h3>
    <div class="underline"></div>
    
    <p><i>Unibanco,</i>the third largest private financial institution in Brazil, has been
disseminating the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) among its 28,000 employees
since December of 1999.</p>
    
    <p>The system was baptized the management panel (PDG), involving the four
business units of the bank- retail, wholesale, insurance, and asset management
— which had to define their strategy and refine it into more specific objectives.</p>
    
    <p>At the end of 2000,<i>Unibanco¶s</i> plan was defined, aligning the BSC of each
business unit with the corporate plan. The executives opted to explain the
methodology to the 28,000 employees and created a symbol for the PDG.
Several events were promoted where Pedro Moreira Salles, shareholder and
president, and the executives from the business units spoke to the managers
about the mechanisms of BSC functioning. Other resources used for dissemination were an explanatory video with Salles’ participation, favors that alluded
to the use of the tool, as well as a broad dissemination of the theme in the internal
newsletter and the intranet.
Even though BSC is used sim</p>
    
    <p>Even though BSC is used simultaneously in the four business units, the pace of
implementation is different for each.</p>
    
    <p>In the wholesale unit, the process of disseminating the BSC needed to be
revised. According to Maria Luisa Mendes, director of the wholesale bank,
“We perceived that the BSC was being discussed only at monthly meetings of
the executive council”. To reverse this picture and to involve other executives,
it was permitted that they also have access to the software programs for
monitoring the progress of BSC activities in the wholesale unit. The unit also
needed to review some of its performance indicators.</p>
    
    <p>For example, the wholesale bank did image research which measured the
success of a strategic goal, <i>“to be seen by client companies as a solid,
        credible institution,”</i> comparing itself to 16 other banks. According to
Cristiano Cagne, planning manager for the wholesale unit, “We analyzed our
position in relation to banks with little representation in the market or with
activities different than ours.” The study was not abolished, but the number of
banks was reduced, and the bank compared itself only to rival institutions such
as Bradesco, Itaú, ABN, and BankBoston.</p>
    
    <p>On the other hand, one of Unibanco’s business units, AIG Insurance and
Pension funds, had already begun to harvest the fruits of adopting the BSC.
Success in implanting the BSC in this unit can be associated to the good
development of its strategic map and to incorporating it into the unit’s everyday
life. The first BSC was in 2000, when executives decided that the system was
to be used to help the unit arrive among the three largest insurance companies
in the country in a period of three years, in terms of measures of liquid profit,
client satisfaction, and market participation. Of these goals, it has already</p>
    
    <br><br><br>
    
    
    <p>reached second place in the item client satisfaction, and expects to reach third
place in liquid profit this year, and should be in fourth place in market
participation, making it a nearly complete victory.</p>
    
    
    <p>Unibanco AIG carried out its action plans and met the objectives defined by the
strategic map. Among them is maintaining the combined index below 100%,
meaning reducing the chances of casualties by clients and operating expenses,
and thus profiting more with revenue from annuities. Presently Unibanco AIG’s
combined index is 99.8%, against the 107% market average.</p>
    
    <p>Another objective described in the strategic map, which is to increase sales of
the more profitable products such as life insurance and private retirement plans,
was also achieved. The sale of private retirement plans and insurance such as
        life, home, and freight, which had an average 800,000<i>reais</i>(November 2000),
recorded premiums at the prize-winning level of 22 millionreais (in December
2002). One of those responsible was the Rally of incentive program, focused
on brokers. This goal of increasing revenue by widening market participation
for more lucrative products is balanced by other objectives linked to increased
productivity, with respect for the budget from the financial perspective.</p>
    
    <p>Every Monday, the main executives of the unit check the progress of the BSC.
Three executives directing the BSC in the unit advise José Rudge, president of
Unibanco AIG. He calls Irany Strumiello, the project manager, the “control
panel. Irany tells me what actions are in process and when it is necessary to turn
on the red light.” Ana Paula Hubert, quality manager, is a kind of guardian of
BSC methodology, clearing up conceptual doubts and defining better indicators. Finally, Valeria Luchesi, human resources supervisor, defines compensation for employees when goals are met.</p>
    
    <p>For the period 2003-2006,<i>Unibanco Insurance</i>is already working with a
new balanced scorecard.</p>

    <h2>Strategies For The<br>
New Economy And<br>
Dynamic Competitive<br>
Environment</h2>
    
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <div class="underline"></div>
    </center>
    
    <p>The so-called “New Economy” has expanded market competition to a world
scale — no longer is it local or regional. Thus, decisions which are made or
events that occur in one part of the planet can have repercussions for the rest
of the world. In addition, the interrelationships between companies can involve
actors who are very far away from each other.</p>
    
    <p>Information Technology (IT) is seen as the factor that has made this worldwide
integration possible, along with the creation of new business strategies, new
organizational structures, and new modes of relationship among companies and
between business and consumers (Laurindoet al., 2003; Laurindo et al., 2001).</p>
    
    <p>The Internet is the IT application with highest visibility, since it provides the
        infrastructure for developing strategic IT applications, of which<i>e-business</i> and
        <i>e-commerce </i>are the most outstanding (Evans & Wuster, 1997; Frontini,
1999).</p>
    
    <p>This has given rise to virtual organizations, the companies whose activities are
exclusively on the Internet, while simultaneously, traditional businesses have</p>
    
    
    <br><br><br>
    
    <p>become active on the web. New forms of association and relationships in
business have also come into being. IT makes a new form of integration viable:
virtual integration, which has become a strong alternative to vertical integration,
which is losing its potential as a source of competitive advantage, according to
Venkatraman and Henderson (1998).</p>
    
    <p>After the initial period during which many innovative initiatives appeared and
then disappeared, the need for a well-defined strategy became clear. Early
interest in business to consumer (B2C) shifted to an interest in business-tobusiness (B2B), where large companies explored the features of this new and
powerful tool.</p>
    
    
    <p>In Porter’s (2001) opinion, while the Internet is the best IT platform developed
to date to reinforce a distinctive strategy, businesses have committed many
errors in utilizing it, because they lack a strategic vision. Further, he argues that
the founding principles of traditional strategy are necessary to the success of
companies that use the Internet. He does not believe in a “New Economy” or
the revolutionary nature of the Internet. In turn, other authors such as Tapscott
(2001) see in the Internet an agent that ruptures economic activities, to the point
that strategy must be revised totally.</p>
    
    <p>With this scenario in mind, it is important to understand these concepts and
paths for strategy in the midst of this turbulent environment and in virtual space,
so that the entire potential of the Interest can yield new organizational forms,
both intra and extra-company.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <center>
    <h2>Seeking to Understand the<br>
New Economy</h2>
    <div class="underline"></div></center>
    
<p>What is usually called the New Economy is strongly connected to two other
terms: globalization and virtuality.</p>
    
    <p>The term “globalization” has been widely disseminated and gained both fans
and enemies. Since the 1970s, countries have become more interdependent
due to the flow of goods, services, and capital. An orientation toward the
external market has become strongly correlated with development in several
countries. This process has been underscored with the distribution of production activities to different countries, involving international investment and
outsourcing and promoting a functional integration of the world economy.</p>
    
    <br><br><br>
    
    
    <p>Thus a new global capitalism has come into being. Both activities and the
organization of these activities have been internationalized, yet there is a
perception that gains from globalization have not been distributed in an
egalitarian manne (Gereffi et al., 2001).</p>
    
    <p>As these same authors stress, the phenomenon of internationalization itself is
not new, since in a certain sense it has been going on since the 18th century, with
the founding of the colonial empires, which sought new sources for raw
materials and new consumers markets for their manufactured products. Even
in the ancient Roman Empire a similar situation could be observed. Globalization implies a functional integration among activities dispersed throughout
several countries. This lends great importance to an examination of the chains
of value as a way to understand the means to promote this integration.</p>
    
    <p>Three major groups of factors are determinants for globalized competition:
technologies, institutions, and organizational innovations (Gereffi, 2001).</p>
    
    <p>The so-called “New Economy” is related to this new globalized reality, with an
emphasis on the issue of technology, in which the Internet has become the agent
that makes it possible to give a new configuration to activities (Tapscott, 2001).
According to Gereffi (2001), many call this new situation the “digital economy”,
        the “economy of innovation”, “network economy” or “electronic economy” <i>(e-economy).</i> Thus, the New Economy is frequently viewed as the economy of the
        Internet, of <i>e-business,</i> where organizational relationships take on new forms
and new dimensions where the virtual aspect stands out. </p>
    
    <p>It is worth discussing what “virtual” means, since this term comes up so often
when talking about the New Economy and the Internet. According to
Chandrashekar and Schary (1999), virtuality can take on three different
meanings in the context of business and the supply chain (see Chapter III).</p>
    
    <p>Firstly, it can mean all the computer communications which have replaced
human participation. This includes IT applications such as CAD/CAM or PCP
systems, which permit better processing of orders, quicker production, automated requisitions and office administration.</p>
    
    <p>The second meaning is related to the idea of a “supra-organization”, in which
each partner has a specific role. Even before IT resources existed, there were
“supra-organizations”, for example, construction firms, travel agencies, and
clothing manufacturers. However, the use of IT allowed the pre-existing
“supra-organizations” to operate more efficiently.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, the third meaning has to do with the development of organizations
united fundamentally through IT networks, where establishing networks still</p>
    
    <br><br><br>
    
    <p>requires personal contact, but once the network has been set up, future
transactions are all electronic.</p>
    
    <p>The turbulent environment of the New Economy will be discussed in this
chapter, based on these two concepts: globalization and virtuality linked to the
use of the Internet, which are new variables to be used in building a successful
strategy.</p>
    
    <center>
    <h2>The Electronic Markets</h2>
    <div class="underline"></div>
    </center>
    
    <p>For a long time, vertical integration (including in the same organization,
assembly activities and the flow of the value chain) was seen as an important
means of reducing costs with a significant strategic impacts.</p>
    
    <p>But, by expanding the range of possibilities, the use of IT modified the
importance of verticalization.</p>
    
    <p>As we saw in Chapter V, Information Technology (IT) has played a primary roll
in the strategy of the leading companies in competitive markets, changing
competitiveness throughout the chains and systems of value (Porter, 2001;
Porter & Millar, 1985, among others). Special mention is given to applications
        based in the Internet, such as <i>e-commerce</i> and/or <i>e-business.</i> Still, the idea of
commercializing goods and services via IT predates the commercial dissemination of the Internet.</p>
    
    <p>Malone et al. (1989) conjectured that IT might cause a break in the patterns of
commerce and distribution, as well as producing a new form of connection
among suppliers and their clients. Since it reduced the cost of transactions
(including the cost of negotiations, of celebrating contracts, and of locating the
best suppliers) companies started to purchase goods and service that formerly
would have been advantageous to produce internally. As a result, vertical
integration became the least interesting option in many cases and the business
networks that carried our different stages in the value chain could form
partnerships of aggregated value and play a more important role within the
structure of industries.</p>
    
    <p>At first there were IT connections between a company and a supplier or a
business and buyer. When IT applications became able to allow access to
various alternatives for buyers and sellers, the electronic market came into
being. Manufacturing enterprises, according to Malone et al., were in a</p>
    
    <br><br><br>
    
    
    <p>privileged position to establish the electronic market, since they are both buyers
and sellers. These authors also believe that companies with a strong market
position could require that their information needs be supplied in the format that
they used. When an isolated company did not have sufficient power to create
an electronic market, it could associate with others, as in the case cited by
Malone et al. of an electronic market created by an association of cotton
producers in the United States. In this way, even small companies could
associate and thus confront the larger participants in the established electronic
markets.</p>
    
    <p>The existence of electronic markets could be a threat as well as an opportunity
for the traditional intermediaries, since they represented new opportunities for
relating and for seeking information for companies and made locating businesses with better performance and better price conditions easier.

    <p>According to Rayport and Sviokla (1995), there are differences between the
        real market <i>(marketplace)</i> and the virtual market <i>(marketspace).</i> To be
successful in the marketspace, five principles should be followed:</p>
    
    <p>• The law of digital assets, which are not consumed upon being used and
therefore can be used indefinitely;</p>
    
    <p>• New economies of scale, allowing small companies to achieve low unit
costs in markets dominated by large companies;</p>
    
    <p>• New economies of scope, permitting the creation of new digital assets,
providing value in various different markets;</p>
    
    <p>• Compression of the cost of transaction, which is lower in the virtual value
chain than in the physical value chain;</p>
    
    <p>• Balance between supply and demand, as a result of combining the four
above principles, shifting one’s view from the supply to the demand side.</p>
    
    <p>These principles, and especially the economies of scope and of scale, point to
opportunities for new forms of both intra and interbusiness organization that can
occur.</p>

    <h2>The Internet as a New Strategic Agent</h2>
    <div class="underline"></div>
    </center>
    
    <p>As seen above, the appearance and dissemination of the commercial use of the
Internet made the virtual market a reality, and new forms of cooperation and
relationship among businesses became viable. But it is not enough just to use
the Internet: the way the Internet is used should aim at obtaining greater efficacy
in the results (Laurindo & Lamounier, 2000).
</p>
    
    <p>To understand better the “virtual market” that some call<i>Cyber Space,</i> Anghern
(1997) developed a model called ICDT <i>(Information, Communication,
        Distribution, and Transaction)</i> Four ways of acting on the internet can be
visualized using the model (Figure 7.1).</p>
    
    <p>First is the <i>virtual information space</i> by which the company becomes visible
to consumers throughout the world, 24 hours a day. It can collect valuable
information about visitors, but the risk is that it is easy for customers to
comparison shop.</p>
    
    <p>The next space is the <i>virtual communication space</i> where the key word is
interaction. It allows one to get beyond physical limitations to create different
forms of communication among companies and clients: e-mail, discussion
        forums, virtual meetings, etc.</p>
    
    <p>In the <i>virtual distribution space,</i> businesses can dispense with intermediaries
to reach their customers, gain time, and reduce costs. They can lend varied
types of services; collect important information, which would be difficult or
costly to obtain by other means (such as opinions of books by readers
throughout the world); and make it available to clients.</p>

    <p>Finally, there is <i>e-commerce,</i> both B2C <i>(business to consumer)</i> and B2B
        <i>(business-to-business)</i> in the <i>virtual transaction space.</i></p>
    
    <p>Note that in addition to B2B (the link between companies) and B2C (the link
between business and customers), we can speak of C2B (the link from
customer to company) and C2C (the link among customers). These last two
cases can include portals for auctions. Another connection that became
possible with the Internet was the interaction of government with the private
sector, especially with suppliers, which is called B2G (business-to-government).</p>
    
    
    <p>There are many strategies available to compete in<i>Cyber Space,</i> depending on
whether they are for B2B or B2C, or among “pure players” (businesses that
were born on the Internet and are only active there) or traditional businesses
also active on the Web. It should be stressed that when Anghern´s analysis was
done, the general idea was that barriers to entry in virtual space would be much
reduced.</p>
    
    <p>Evans and Wurster (1999) posit three important variables for understanding
competition in the virtual market of the Web, which they call “navigational
advantage” — reach, wealth, and affiliation.</p>
    
    <p><i>Reach</i> is related to access and to the connection. This means knowing how
many consumers can be accessed and how many products can be offered to
        them. Usually, the reach is the most perceptible difference between <i>e-commerce</i> and traditional commerce, since the Web allows one to reach a much
greater number of customers, both individuals and businesses.</p>
    
    <p><i>Wealth</i> is related to the depth and level of detail of the information provided to
consumers. Usually, businesses have had problems in using this dimension of
the virtual market adequately. Problems can be overcome if businesses
strengthen connections with their customers and if they use a more strategic
vision</p>
    
    <p><i>Affiliation</i>is a new dimension of competition on the Web and is related to
which interests the virtual business represents: a company, a group of companies, consumers, an independent agent, etc.</p>
    
    <p>These authors also explain the different strategies for different kinds of business
acting on the Internet. For a “pure player” type, for example, competing for
reach is a critical factor in success. For a company that provides a virtual
service as an alternative to a traditional service, the wealth variable has
important significance. The affiliation variable is relevant Evans and Wurster
(1999) for a portal that intermediates among companies.</p>
    
    <br><br><br>
    
    
    <p>The Internet also permits that networks inside businesses be created using the
same standard electronic communication protocol and the same interface with
the users: these are called intranets which can be very wide-ranging as in the
case of geographically disperse companies, such as the multinationals.</p>

    <h2>The Appearance of<br>
Virtual Organizations</h2>
    <div class="underline"></div>
    </center>
    
    
    <p>The concept of virtual organizations precedes the use of the Internet.
Chandrashekar and Schary (1999) highlight the earlier idea of “imaginary
organizations”, based on trust, synergy among partners, contracts, and a
central concept of business and of IT. Civil engineering companies, travel
agencies, and software developers were able to operate without long-term
relationships and networks among businesses could be created or deactivated
in real time.</p>
    
    <p>IT made a new form of integration possible: <i>virtual integration,</i>which arrived
as a strong alternative to vertical integration, which then began to lose its
potential as a source of competitive advantage. This fact, alongside greater
opportunity to interact with clients, the leveling of knowledge and the importance of a solid IT platform, constituted the bases of the strategy of virtual
organizations according to Venkatraman and Henderson (1998).</p>
    
    <p>For these authors, <i>virtual organization</i> can be a strategic approach aimed at
creating and distributing intellectual assets, at the same time that it permits the
search for physical tangible benefits, creating a complex network of relationships. Virtual organization comprises the three vectors cited above (interaction
with consumers, shaping IT assets and leveling of knowledge) and three stages:
the level of the tasks, the level of organization and the level of inter- organizational networks.</p>
    
    <p>These three stages were usually approached independently, as for example,
isolated applications of EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) and the integration
of CAD/CAM between purchasers and suppliers. With the dissemination of
integrated ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) and, more importantly, the
adoption of the standardized Internet protocols, it was possible to have a
common technological platform which facilitated the existence of virtual
organizations.</p>
